    <h1>My First Blog</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Blog Profiles! Each week, we select a topic and handful of blogs that do a great job contributing to the conversation. Do you have a blog that deserves recognition? Tweet our writers at @akanksha.Poetry Blog ProfilesWriting is a huge part of my life.

I’ve spent decades in the journalism and communications industry. In my free time, I freelance and ghostwrite.

My relationship with words is as important as my body’s relationship with breath.

But poetry remains an area of writing that’s a mystery to me.

Here are four poetry blogs I discovered that beautifully carry on this mystery, while supporting their writers and their craft.

<h2>1. Harriet Blog – Poetry Foundation</h2>
<p>Harriet is a blog of The Poetry Foundation, which publishes Poetry magazine.

The foundation is an independent literary group committed to a “vigorous presence for poetry in our culture. It exists to discover and celebrate the best poetry and to place it before the largest possible audience.”

The blog features poems, poets, prose, and collections.

I like this blog for a lot of reasons. More than just poetry, the content really gets you thinking about other things that affect the poetry world.</p>
<h2>2. The Poetry Project</h2>
<p>The Poetry Project has a long and unusual history.

According to the site, in the summer of 1966, The Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery was founded as a direct successor to, and continuation of, the various coffeehouse reading series that had flourished on the Lower East Side since 1960.

That was just the beginning.

Today, The Poetry Project promotes, fosters and inspires the reading and writing of contemporary poetry through live programming, the website, workshops, publications, and special events. It presents poetry to diverse audiences and provides a community where poets and artists can exchange ideas and information.</p>
